# fac-bench

Factorial benchmark in different languages. Showcase expressivity and speed, in
development as well as execution.

## Specification

Calculate the first 3000 factorials, sum them and print the number out. To get
meaningful results you should implement fac the naive way.

## Structure

A subfolder per language. Each folder should contain a file named `build` that
ensures the executable is ready.

## CI

On push all benchmarks are executed and results checked.
